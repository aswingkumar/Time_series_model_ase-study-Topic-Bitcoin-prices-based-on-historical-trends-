The Bitcoin price forecasting project involves analyzing historical BTC/USD trading data using time series models. The dataset includes daily records of Bitcoinâ€™s open, high, low, close prices, trading volume, and market capitalization. The analysis begins with exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of price trends. Stationarity is checked using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, and first-order differencing is applied if needed. The Auto ARIMA function helps determine the best parameters for the ARIMA model, which is then trained and used for forecasting future prices. The model's accuracy is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Additionally, deep learning approaches like LSTMs can be incorporated for improved long-term predictions. This project provides insights into Bitcoin price movements and helps investors make data-driven decisions.
